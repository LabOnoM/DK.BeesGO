## Verification of the CID2ATGC convert algorithm.

Let's use the example below

```
Read name = E150018299L1C036R00400117279  
Read length = 100bp  
Flags = 0  
----------------------  
Mapping = Primary @ MAPQ 255  
Reference span = chr3:129,504,132-129,504,231 (+) = 100bp  
Cigar = 100M  
Clipping = None  
----------------------  
XF = 4  
NH = 1  
HI = 1  
nM = 0  
UR = 6B507  
AS = 98  
Cx = 6518  
Cy = 12274
