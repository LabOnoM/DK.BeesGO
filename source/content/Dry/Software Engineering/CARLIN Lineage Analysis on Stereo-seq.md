Following with the [[Extract Tissue CIDs from Stereo-seq]], this workflow enables the extraction and analysis of CARLIN barcode amplicons from **unmapped Stereo-seq reads**, which are filtered and cleaned by SAW but not aligned to the reference genome (as CARLIN sequences are synthetic).

## üß≠ **1. Overview of the Problem**

- SAW (`saw count`) processes Stereo-seq data using the STAR aligner.
- CARLIN barcodes are **non-genomic**, so STAR cannot align them.
- CARLIN reads are therefore retained in the `--unmapped-fastq` output.
- However, SAW outputs only **R2** for unmapped reads; **R1 (UMI)** must be recovered manually.

## üì• **2. Generate Unmapped Reads via SAW**

```bash
saw count \
  --unmapped-fastq \
  --clean-reads-fastq \
  ... (other required arguments)
```

‚úÖ This produces a lot of `*_1.pure_unmapped_reads.fq` files. Just same as the output from [--clean-reads-fastq](https://stereotoolss-organization.gitbook.io/saw-user-manual-v8.1/analysis/pipelines/saw-commands#saw-count) option (see [[Extract Tissue CIDs from Stereo-seq#2. The [--clean-reads-fastq](https //stereotoolss-organization.gitbook.io/saw-user-manual-v8.1/analysis/pipelines/saw-commands saw-count) option in `saw` software]]), although the fq was named as `*_1*`, it actually only contains the biological sequences from R2. 

To reduce the computing cost, we only do the analysis on the reads located within the tissue. Therefore, we need to filter and combine the `--unmapped-fastq` resulted files into a single `R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq` by using the `tissue_xy_coords.txt` from [[Extract Tissue CIDs from Stereo-seq#1. What's inside the `*.tissue.gef`?]] with `filter_cleanR1_by_XY_parallel.sh` below:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ===== CONFIG =====
XY_LIST="barcodeToPos_tissue.txt"
OUTFILE="R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq"
TMPDIR="tmp_cleanR1"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"

echo "üìÑ Preparing whitelist..."
# Extract and sort unique XY coordinates (Cx, Cy)
cut -f2,3 "$XY_LIST" | sort | uniq > whitelist_xy.txt

# Export for GNU parallel
export TMPDIR
export WL="$(realpath whitelist_xy.txt)"  # Use full path to avoid parallel context issues

# ===== FUNCTION: PROCESS EACH FILE =====
process_cleanR1() {
    fq="$1"
    base=$(basename "$fq" _1.pure_unmapped_reads.fq)
    tmpout="$TMPDIR/${base}.tissue.fq"

    gawk -v WL="$WL" -v OUT="$tmpout" '
        BEGIN {
            while ((getline line < WL) > 0) {
                gsub(/\r/, "", line)  # Remove Windows-style line endings
                valid_xy[line] = 1
            }
        }
        {
            if (substr($0,1,1) == "@") {
                id = $0
                getline seq
                getline plus
                getline qual
                if (match(id, /\|Cx:i:([0-9]+)\|Cy:i:([0-9]+)/, m)) {
                    xy = m[1] "\t" m[2]
                    if (xy in valid_xy) {
                        print id >> OUT
                        print seq >> OUT
                        print plus >> OUT
                        print qual >> OUT
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ' "$fq"
}
export -f process_cleanR1

# ===== PARALLEL PROCESSING =====
echo "üöÄ Filtering reads based on XY coordinates..."
ls *_1.pure_unmapped_reads.fq | parallel --bar -j "$(nproc)" process_cleanR1 {}

# ===== MERGE RESULTS =====
echo "üß¨ Merging into $OUTFILE..."
if ls $TMPDIR/*.tissue.fq 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then
    cat $TMPDIR/*.tissue.fq > "$OUTFILE"
    echo "‚úÖ Done. Output written to $OUTFILE"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No matching reads found. Output file was not created."
fi
```

## üîÅ **3. Recover Corresponding R1 Reads**

Since SAW doesn‚Äôt output R1 unmapped reads, we:

- Extract the **read IDs** from `R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq`
- Match and recover corresponding R1 reads from the **raw `.fq.gz` files**

Python script
```python
import os
import re
import subprocess
import multiprocessing
from tqdm import tqdm

r2_fastq = "/mnt/md0/22_Pam/MyCustomBank/reads/R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq"
r1_files = sorted([f for f in os.listdir(".") if f.endswith("_1.fq.gz")])
output_file = "R1.tissue.unmapped.fastq"
temp_dir = "./r1_temp_blocks"

# === Step 1: extract R2 read IDs ===
os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)
r2_order = []
r2_set = set()

print("üì• Extracting ordered R2 read IDs...")
with open(r2_fastq, "r") as f:
    while True:
        header = f.readline()
        _ = f.readline(); _ = f.readline(); _ = f.readline()
        if not header:
            break
        match = re.match(r"@([^| ]+)", header)
        if match:
            rid = match.group(1)
            r2_order.append(rid)
            r2_set.add(rid)

print(f"‚úÖ Found {len(r2_order)} total R2 IDs")

# === Step 2: parallel block writing ===
def extract_matched_reads(r1_file):
    written = 0
    cmd = ["zcat", r1_file]
    proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    while True:
        header = proc.stdout.readline()
        seq = proc.stdout.readline()
        plus = proc.stdout.readline()
        qual = proc.stdout.readline()
        if not qual:
            break
        match = re.match(r"@([^/| ]+)", header)
        if match:
            key = match.group(1)
            if key in r2_set:
                with open(f"{temp_dir}/{key}.fq", "w") as temp_out:
                    temp_out.write(f"@{key}\n{seq}{plus}{qual}")
                written += 1
    return os.path.basename(r1_file), written

print("üöÄ Extracting R1 reads in parallel...")
with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=min(multiprocessing.cpu_count(), 16)) as pool:
    results = list(tqdm(pool.imap_unordered(extract_matched_reads, r1_files), total=len(r1_files)))

# Summary
total_written = sum(x[1] for x in results)
print(f"‚úÖ Done extracting. Total matched reads written to temp: {total_written}")

# === Step 3: assemble final R1 FASTQ in R2 order ===
print(f"üìù Writing final R1 FASTQ to {output_file} in R2 order...")
with open(output_file, "w") as out:
    for rid in tqdm(r2_order, desc="Writing ordered R1"):
        path = f"{temp_dir}/{rid}.fq"
        if os.path.exists(path):
            with open(path, "r") as f:
                out.writelines(f.readlines())

print(f"‚úÖ Final R1 file complete. Total reads written: {total_written}")

```

**Final output:**  
`R1.tissue.unmapped.fastq` with headers exactly matching `R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq`

## ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Define a Custom CARLIN Configuration**

**`CustomCfg.json`:**
```json
{
  "type": "Bulk",
  "UMI.length": 26,
  "UMI.location": "L",
  "read_perspective": {
    "ShouldComplement": "N",
    "ShouldReverse": "Y"
  },
  "trim": {
    "Primer5": "exact",
    "Primer3": "malformed",
    "SecondarySequence": "ignore"
  }
}

```

Based on the observations:
- CID+UMI is 26 bp at the 5‚Ä≤ end of R1
- R2 reads are in reverse orientation relative to the CARLIN amplicon reference

Please check [https://gitlab.com/hormozlab/carlin](https://gitlab.com/hormozlab/carlin) for more details about the **`CustomCfg.json`** options.

## üöÄ **5. Run the CARLIN Analysis Pipeline**
In MatLab:
```matlab
analyze_CARLIN({'./reads/R1.tissue.unmapped.fastq', './reads/R2.tissue.unmapped.fastq'}, CFG_TYPE='./CustomCfg.json, './Output');
cd("./Output/");
load('./Summary.mat');
load('./Bank.mat');
p_clonal = bank.compute_clonal_pvalue(summary);
writematrix(p_clonal,'P_Con.txt');
p_frequency = bank.compute_frequency_pvalue(summary);
writematrix(p_frequency,'P_Freq.txt');
plot_allele_frequency_CDF(summary, 'A02598A4');
plot_indel_freq_vs_length(summary);
plot_site_decomposition(summary, true, 'A02598A4', '# of Transcripts');
plot_stargate.create(summary);
```
