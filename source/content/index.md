[DK.BeesGO](https://www.bs-gou.com/DK.BeesGO/) is a digital knowledge repository designed to integrate both [[Wet/index|wet-lab]] and [[Dry/index|dry-lab]] experiments in a unified, interactive platform. By leveraging the bidirectional linking capabilities of Quartz, DK.BeesGO enables a dynamic Graph View that visually maps the interconnections between biological materials, experimental procedures, analytical data, and bioinformatics workflows. This structure allows [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html) to intuitively explore and understand the complex relationships between empirical experimentation and computational analysis.

### Organizational Structure

To maintain clarity and scalability, topics in DK.BeesGO are categorized primarily by biological molecules, structures, or chemical components relevant to cells, organisms, or microbiomes. Each topic is organized under two major directories:
 - [[Wet/Nucleic Acid/index|Nucleic Acid]], Protein, [[Wet/Metabolite/index|Metabolites]], Materials, etc. under [[Wet/index|Wet]] directory
 - [[Dry/Nucleic Acid/index|Nucleic Acid]], Protein, [[Dry/Metabolite/index|Metabolites]], Materials, etc. under [[Dry/index|Dry]] directory

As shown above, in DK.BeesGO, subfolders such as **Nucleic Acid**, **Protein**, and **Lipid** are intentionally mirrored under both the [[Wet/index|Wet]]  and [[Dry/index|Dry]] directories. **This parallel design makes it easy to trace how biological materials transition from experimental protocols in the wet lab to analytical methods and results in computational studies.** This design reflects our core philosophy: biological materials are central to both experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) research. By maintaining a parallel structure, we allow users to seamlessly trace how the same biological entities are studied, manipulated, and interpreted across domains.

However, there are [[Wet/index|Wet]] or [[Dry/index|Dry]] specific folders, such as:
 - Reagents, etc. under [[Wet/index|Wet]] directory
 - [[Dry/Software Engineering/index|Software Engineering]], etc. under [[Dry/index|Dry]] directory

As the database evolves, it is expected to become a valuable resource for [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) members, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interplay between biological experiments and bioinformatics.
