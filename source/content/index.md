[DK.BeesGO](https://www.bs-gou.com/DK.BeesGO/) is a digital knowledge repository designed to integrate both [[Wet/index|wet-lab]] and [[Dry/index|dry-lab]] experiments. By leveraging the bidirectional linking capabilities of Quartz, it offers a Graph View that visually maps the interconnections between biological experiments, data, results, and bioinformatics/data science analyses. This structure aims to help [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) members intuitively explore and understand the relationships between experimental and computational research.

As the database evolves, it is expected to become a valuable resource for [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) members, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interplay between biological experiments and bioinformatics.
