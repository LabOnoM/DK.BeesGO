[DK.BeesGO](https://www.bs-gou.com/DK.BeesGO/) is a digital knowledge repository designed to integrate both [[Wet/index|wet-lab]] and [[Dry/index|dry-lab]] experiments in a unified, interactive platform. By leveraging the bidirectional linking capabilities of Quartz, DK.BeesGO enables a dynamic Graph View that visually maps the interconnections between biological materials, experimental procedures, analytical data, and bioinformatics workflows. This structure allows [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html) to intuitively explore and understand the complex relationships between empirical experimentation and computational analysis.

As the database evolves, it is expected to become a valuable resource for [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) members, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interplay between biological experiments and bioinformatics.

## Organizational Structure

To maintain clarity and scalability, topics in DK.BeesGO are categorized primarily by biological molecules, structures, or chemical components relevant to cells, organisms, or microbiomes. Each topic is organized under two major directories:
 - [[Wet/Nucleic Acid/index|Nucleic Acid]], Protein, [[Wet/Metabolite/index|Metabolites]], Materials, etc. under [[Wet/index|Wet]] directory
 - [[Dry/Nucleic Acid/index|Nucleic Acid]], Protein, [[Dry/Metabolite/index|Metabolites]], Materials, etc. under [[Dry/index|Dry]] directory

As shown above, in DK.BeesGO, subfolders such as **Nucleic Acid**, **Protein**, and **Lipid** are intentionally mirrored under both the [[Wet/index|Wet]]  and [[Dry/index|Dry]] directories. **This parallel design makes it easy to trace how biological materials transition from experimental protocols in the wet lab to analytical methods and results in computational studies.** This design reflects our core philosophy: biological materials are central to both experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) research. By maintaining a parallel structure, we allow users to seamlessly trace how the same biological entities are studied, manipulated, and interpreted across domains.

However, there are [[Wet/index|Wet]] or [[Dry/index|Dry]] specific folders, such as:
 - [[Wet/Reagents/index|Reagents]], etc. under [[Wet/index|Wet]] directory
 - [[Dry/Software Engineering/index|Software Engineering]], etc. under [[Dry/index|Dry]] directory

## ShinyApps in BSGOU-choice
To empower learners and researchers with high-quality, ready-to-use tools, [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) curates a special selection of outstanding ShinyApps from the global bioinformatics community—known as **[[ShinyApps in BSGOU-choice/index|BSGOU-choice]]**. These are may not developed by [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) itself, but are carefully evaluated and recommended by [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html) for their usability, reproducibility, and educational value. **[[ShinyApps in BSGOU-choice/index|BSGOU-choice]]** highlights ShinyApps that meet real research and learning needs across a wide range of use cases.

In **[[ShinyApps in BSGOU-choice/index|BSGOU-choice]]**, Each app is reviewed and tested by [BSGOU](https://www.bs-gou.com/) [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html) to ensure reliability and pedagogical value. They are then integrated into our internal teaching platforms and linked within [[index|DK.BeesGO]] for contextual learning. Where possible, we provide translated tutorials, example datasets, and [GitHub mirrors](https://github.com/Bees-GO?tab=repositories) to improve accessibility.

By spotlighting these excellent tools, we aim to reduce barriers to entry, accelerate data-driven discovery, and provide our learners—especially those without programming experience—with immediate access to world-class analytical environments.
